Time base objects


Brainstorm of time base objects

- A feature that we could add is that the player can set his work hours or shift
	- Some examples: 9 a.m - 5 p.m shift, or a 8 a.m - 2 p.m shift
	- Would have a in game clock where a whole day is 12 minutes
		- 30 seconds is an hour
		
- During their shift there will be a chance that a button will appear.
	- 1/20 chance
- Player can click the button and be rewarded or lose some things

Rewards:
	- Extra work hours in different amounts
		- Could earn 5, 10, 15 work hours
	- Gain some extra money
		- message: "Found $5 by the vending machine"

Potential loses:
	- Lose some work hours
		- message: "Binge some series"
	- Lose some money
		-message: "Went out to lunch"

- Want to make the reward to lose ratio around a 70/30

Some things to think about:

- How often will this feature appear during the player's shift.
- If the feature pops up, should there be a cooldown before it can pop up again
	-maybe a 2 minute cooldown
		- it would be 4 in game hours
