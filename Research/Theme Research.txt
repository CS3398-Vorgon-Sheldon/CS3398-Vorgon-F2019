Summary: Press the "Work button" to accumulate "work time". As work time increases "clients" come in asking you to do work for them.
	All the work time you've accumulated up till now can be used to complete these jobs rewarding "dollars". Dollars will be the currency to pay for items in the shop.
	The shop will house upgrades. First tier of upgrades will be focused solely on making the work button accumulate work time faster. Additive, multiplicative, "critical presses".
	Second tier of upgrades will get you employees. Employees accumulate work time without hitting the work button. 
	Upgrades in this tier will consist of increasing maximum workers available, increasing work time per worker, and the level up effects. (If worker A has worked enough then they reach level 2 and gain stats)
	Clients will work in tiered system, tier 1 we do jobs for students, then more advanced placements CS I, CSII, Data Structs, Software Design, etc... Till we reach The next tier.
	Tier 2 of clients can be businesses who pay more on their projects. Tier 3 may be government jobs. Flavor text can be parody of real world companies, and going through classes.

More To think about: Prestige function

Stretch Goals: Down the line we may add different kinds of Employees. For example, Accountants who increase money gain per client job.
	Another example would be hiring tiers, and "promotions" Tier 1 worker gets x amount but when he reaches max level, promote him to manager and he can train his own team of employees that won't add to your counter of max employees.
	Mentioned contracts in class that act like jobs but are only available for limited amount of time.
