Things to keep in mind when creating the user interface:
    - Keep it simple, we do not want the user to be overwhelmed when navigating
      around the game.
    - Consistency is important; graphic elements and functionality should be
      consistent across the program.
    - Minimize the need to recall information. Everything should be straight
      forward.
    - Less is more. Less clutter provides a better user experience.

Design decisions that we will have to make and other notes:
    - Do we want clean menus - with each feature implementation being a new
      page?
    - Or do we want to minimize the amount of pages - and design the interface
      in a way that displays most information cleanly in a main screen?
    - Is there an approach or design that fits in with our theme more?
    - Are there any limitations that we need to keep in mind when designing the
      GUI? (prevent possible roadblocks)

Personal take:
    - After some short discussion, we as a team should have an overall idea on
      how we want the user interface to be. Once we have this image in our heads
      we should be able to approach any design choices with confidence.
